# PS vs PL Traffic Generator Experiments

This folder contains scripts for the Arm host processor.  Make sure the traffic
generator image is deployed on the board before executing these scripts.

Each script iterates over different benchmark applications running on the APU
and configurations of the traffic generators on the PL.  In `run_tg_pi.sh`, the
traffic generators are the primary interferers.  In `TODO.sh`, the benchmark on
the APU is the primary interferer.  The results reported by the scripts are
TODO.
