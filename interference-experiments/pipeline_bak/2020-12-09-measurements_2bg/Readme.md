These measurements were made using the selfinterference script found in this folder. It was copied
over from the board.

With this script, everything is performed locally:
1. PREMized benchmarks are evaluated without interference.
2. Then with two identical non-PREMized background benchmarks to interfere.
3. Then with two identical PREMized background benchmarks to interfere.

Shortcoming: Uncertainty in program launch order.
