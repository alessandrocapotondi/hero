The HERO project contains digital data under many different licenses. The
license for any data can be determined as follows, ordered by decreasing
precedence:
1. From the license statement in the file containing the data. License
   statements positioned earlier in the file take precedence over later license
   statements in the same file.
2. From the license file in the directory containing the file that contains the
   data. The file name of the license file starts with "license" or "copying"
   and may be spelled partially or entirely with capital letters.
3. From the license file in the parent directory of the file that contains the
   data, or if that directory does not contain a license file either, in the
   parent directory of the parent directory, and so on until the directory
   containing this file.
4. By e-mail inquiry to `hero (at) iis ee ethz ch` (replace the spaces in the
   domain name with dots and the ` (at) ` with the corresponding character)
   specifying the path of the data whose license you could not determine
   according to points 1-3. The e-mail reply will either refer to one of points
   1-3 or to a newly published commit that defines the license according to
   points 1-3 and mention the determined license.
