	  Determines if random initialization from pre-generated data
	  should be used.  As support for hardware random number
	  generation is currently lacking, this should prevent the boot
	  from hanging waiting for random entropy. The randomized data
	  is pre-generated on the build system and will be the same
	  every boot, making this very INSECURE for production.
