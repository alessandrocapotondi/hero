  bool "Force random initialization from pre-generated data"
  default y
  help
    Determines if random initialization from pre-generated data should be used.
    As support for hardware random number generation is currently lacking, this
    should prevent the boot from hanging waiting for random entropy. The
    randomized data is pre-generated on the build system and will be the same
    every boot, making this very INSECURE for production.

  help

    to the filesystem. Options can be specified before (with -o) as the options
